# Hate Speech Detection using BERT

## Overview

The **Hate Speech Detection using BERT** project uses **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** to classify tweets as either **Hate Speech** or **Free Speech**. This project demonstrates how advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques can be applied to detect and combat hate speech online.

## Features

- **BERT-based Classification**: Utilizes BERT for superior understanding and classification of text.
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Includes evaluation metrics, visualizations, and analysis in Jupyter notebooks.
- **Interactive Exploration**: Jupyter notebooks allow for an interactive examination of data and model performance.
